                                Hattrick the Magician is a 3D Oculus VR game where you play as a stage magician performing magic tricks for an audience.
                                Hattrick started my junior year, as a small prototyping project where we worked to develop a vertical sliver
                                in three weeks. It was then specially chosen as one of five games to move on to our next class in the minor. 
                                We worked over the summer and fall semester of 2021 to polish it.

                        <li>
                            <h4>Primary Role</h4>
                            <p>
                                I worked mainly as a designer for Hattrick.
                                While not having any levels due to it being one "level" with multiple tricks to perform, the tricks were some of 
                                the main sources of our design. I was responsible for five of twelve tricks we designed, but due to time constraints,
                                all but 3 tricks had to be cut in varying stages of completion, and this included mine. However, I also contributed to the thought 
                                processes behind many of the tweaks made to the other tricks. Outside of the tricks, I designed almost all the User Experience of Hattrick including 
                                the overall game loop, title screen functionality, and cut content like our Backstage.

                        <li>
                            <h4>Other Roles</h4>
                            <p>
                                In addition to Design, I helped on both the programming and art side of production. I implemented optimization
                                practices such as occlusion culling and anti-aliasing to help the performance of our game. I also programmed features
                                like our step-by-step checklist for each trick and haptic controller feedback. On the Art side, I was responsible for
                                nearly all of the visual effects for Hattrick.
