                Hattrick the Magician is an ongoing project in my current Game Minor class; MI497. It's a 3D Oculus VR game where you play as a stage magician
                performing magic tricks for an audience. Hattrick started as the last prototyping project in our previous class (MI455),
                where we worked to develop a vertical sliver in three weeks. It was then chosen as one of five games chosen to 
                move on to MI497. We've 
                now worked over the summer and fall semester of 2021 to polish it into a full playable game.

                My role was primarily as a Game Designer.
                Hattrick doesn't have any levels, due to it being one "level" with multiple tricks to perform, so the tricks were some of the main sources of our design.
                I was solely responsible for five of twelve tricks we designed, and contributed to the thought processes behind many of the tweaks and
                changes made to the other tricks. Unfortunately, due to time, my specific tricks had to be cut in varying stages of completion. Outside of the tricks,
                I designed almost all of the User Experience of Hattrick including the overall game loop, title screen functionality, and cut content like our Backstage.

                In addition to Design, I helped out on both the programming and art side of production. I implemented optimization practices such as occlusion culling and
                anti-aliasing to help the performance of our game. I also programmed features like our step-by-step
                checklist for each trick and haptic feedback. On the Art side, I was responsible for nearly all of the visual effects for Hattrick, however due to cut tricks
                a fair bit of them were scrapped as well.
