                      <h4>Game Summary</h4>
                      <p>
                        <i> "The Underbrush is an 2.5D eerie adventure game where you play as a inquisitive young child who 
                        scours the woods in search of mythical cryptids while out camping with their father." </i><br><br>
                        The Underbrush was a student project that I co-led during Spring semester of 2022. This project 
                        started in the last class of my Game Design minor. During this class we were split into teams of 8
                        and paired with mentors from 5 different AAA game companies to work with us during the project. Our team was 
                        paired with mentors from Blizzard. The mentors were there to guide us and help us while also pushing us to uphold the
                        AAA standards.
                      </p>

                    <li>
                      <h4>Primary Role</h4>
                      <p>
                        My primary role was as Co-Producer for the project. I helped lead the team by, coordinating team meetings, 
                        managing feedback, maintaining workflow goals, and many more managerial duties. Our project was plagued with
                        many different challenges that required a lot of us producers. It has been the tallest task I've faced to date, but 
                        I relied on collaboration with the members of my team to make quick and effective decisions based on the challenges
                        we faced.
                      </p>

                      <h4>Other Roles</h4>
                      <p>
                        My first secondary role was a designer. I headed the design team for The Underbrush, contributing to all aspects of the game. 
                        In the first few weeks, I designed and documented the first iteration of our game, complete with requirements for each aspect
                        of the development team. From there I continued to iterate upon and document our idea, with help from other members of my team.
                        I oversaw other elements the team designed and made sure they were up to the standards Blizzard had for us. <br><br>

                        Programming was my other secondary role. I contributed to most of the "glue" that held the game together. I took the systems and AI
                        the other programmers had built and made systems to make sure the game functioned cohesively. On top of that, I helped bug fix many of
                        the bugs we faced during our production.
