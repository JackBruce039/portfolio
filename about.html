                    Hello, my name is Jack Bruce! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a senior majoring in Game Design and Development at Michigan State University. 
                    I'm currently enrolled in MSU's Game Minor program in order to hone my skills even further.
                    I chose the Technical Designer role due to developing my skills in each of the major areas of Game Development.
                    I primarily specialize in the design aspect and am very passionate about thinking about the innerworkings of a game.
                    In addition, I also pride myself in my programming ability after 5 years working in various different languages such as; 
                    C#, Java, Javascript, and HTML. I've only recently gotten into HTML, but I know enough to make this website from scratch. 
                    Lastly, I also have found a knack for art, specifically with Visual Effects and Shadergraph
                    but I have also dabbled in 3D modeling. Personally, I like to think of myself as a Jack of all Trades (pun fully intended).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of games, I enjoy participating in various athletic activities such as soccer, running, and snowboarding. I was on my 
                    High School's Varsity Track and Cross Country team eventually becoming Captain my senior year. I love watching Hockey and 
                    supporting my home team, Go Bolts!
